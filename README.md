# Support

Our repository for support questions.

## Rules

- Ask questions in a way **that can help others in the future**.
    - Use titles and descriptions to describe the *very specific* issue you're having
    - Avoid generic titles like "help please".
- Be respectful of others' time.
    - Everyone answering you is doing so for free, so please be polite and write in a way that can make the best use of everyone's time
- Use the right category for your questions

Questions that go strongly against the rules can be closed or deleted. We want this repository to be a **valuable** resource for everyone.
